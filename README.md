Using your compatible wallet like Trust Wallet to connect to your DApp by using WalletConnect CDN packages.

## Dev notes

Using `@walletconnect/browser` and `@walletconnect/qrcode-modal` for wallet operations. And the `https://ethereum-api.xyz` API for retriving data from the blockchain using the `axios` package.
